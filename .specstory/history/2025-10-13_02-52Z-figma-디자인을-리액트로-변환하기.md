Now I understand the project structure. This is a Design System MCP server that can convert Figma designs to React/Vue components. Let me create a todo list and then use the MCP server to convert the Figma design to React.


---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] Extract Figma file ID from the provided URL
- [ ] Use the MCP server to convert Figma design to React component
- [ ] Generate the React component code based on the Figma design
- [ ] Provide the final React component with proper styling and structure

*Called tool*: desktop-commander - start_process: 
                        Start a new terminal process with intelligent state detection.
                        
                        PRIMARY TOOL FOR FILE ANALYSIS AND DATA PROCESSING
                        This is the ONLY correct tool for analyzing local files (CSV, JSON, logs, etc.).
                        The analysis tool CANNOT access local files and WILL FAIL - always use processes for file-based work.
                        
                        CRITICAL RULE: For ANY local file work, ALWAYS use this tool + interact_with_process, NEVER use analysis/REPL tool.
                        
                        Running on macOS. Default shell: zsh.
        
MACOS-SPECIFIC NOTES:
- Package manager: brew (Homebrew) is commonly used
- Python 3 might be 'python3' command, not 'python'
- Some GNU tools have different names (e.g., gsed instead of sed)
- System Integrity Protection (SIP) may block certain operations
- Use 'open' command to open files/applications from terminal
- For file search: Use mdfind (Spotlight) for fastest exact filename searches
                        
                        REQUIRED WORKFLOW FOR LOCAL FILES:
                        1. start_process("python3 -i") - Start Python REPL for data analysis
                        2. interact_with_process(pid, "import pandas as pd, numpy as np")
                        3. interact_with_process(pid, "df = pd.read_csv('/absolute/path/file.csv')")
                        4. interact_with_process(pid, "print(df.describe())")
                        5. Continue analysis with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
                        
                        COMMON FILE ANALYSIS PATTERNS:
                        • start_process("python3 -i") → Python REPL for data analysis (RECOMMENDED)
                        • start_process("node -i") → Node.js for JSON processing  
                        • start_process("cut -d',' -f1 file.csv | sort | uniq -c") → Quick CSV analysis
                        • start_process("wc -l /path/file.csv") → Line counting
                        • start_process("head -10 /path/file.csv") → File preview
                        
                        BINARY FILE SUPPORT:
                        For PDF, Excel, Word, archives, databases, and other binary formats, use process tools with appropriate libraries or command-line utilities.
                        
                        INTERACTIVE PROCESSES FOR DATA ANALYSIS:
                        1. start_process("python3 -i") - Start Python REPL for data work
                        2. start_process("node -i") - Start Node.js REPL for JSON/JS
                        3. start_process("bash") - Start interactive bash shell
                        4. Use interact_with_process() to send commands
                        5. Use read_process_output() to get responses
                        
                        SMART DETECTION:
                        - Detects REPL prompts (>>>, >, $, etc.)
                        - Identifies when process is waiting for input
                        - Recognizes process completion vs timeout
                        - Early exit prevents unnecessary waiting
                        
                        STATES DETECTED:
                        Process waiting for input (shows prompt)
                        Process finished execution  
                        Process running (use read_process_output)
                        
                        ALWAYS USE FOR: Local file analysis, CSV processing, data exploration, system commands
                        NEVER USE ANALYSIS TOOL FOR: Local file access (analysis tool is browser-only and WILL FAIL)
                        
                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths for reliability. Paths are automatically normalized regardless of slash direction. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.

Tool use: **mcp_desktop-commander_read_file**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: desktop-commander - read_file: 
                        Read the contents of a file from the file system or a URL with optional offset and length parameters.
                        
                        Prefer this over 'execute_command' with cat/type for viewing files.
                        
                        Supports partial file reading with:
                        - 'offset' (start line, default: 0)
                          * Positive: Start from line N (0-based indexing)
                          * Negative: Read last N lines from end (tail behavior)
                        - 'length' (max lines to read, default: configurable via 'fileReadLineLimit' setting, initially 1000)
                          * Used with positive offsets for range reading
                          * Ignored when offset is negative (reads all requested tail lines)
                        
                        Examples:
                        - offset: 0, length: 10     → First 10 lines
                        - offset: 100, length: 5    → Lines 100-104
                        - offset: -20               → Last 20 lines  
                        - offset: -5, length: 10    → Last 5 lines (length ignored)
                        
                        Performance optimizations:
                        - Large files with negative offsets use reverse reading for efficiency
                        - Large files with deep positive offsets use byte estimation
                        - Small files use fast readline streaming
                        
                        When reading from the file system, only works within allowed directories.
                        Can fetch content from URLs when isUrl parameter is set to true
                        (URLs are always read in full regardless of offset/length).
                        
                        Handles text files normally and image files are returned as viewable images.
                        Recognized image types: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP.
                        
                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths for reliability. Paths are automatically normalized regardless of slash direction. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.

Great! The environment file already exists with a Figma access token. Now let me extract the file ID from the Figma URL and use the MCP server to convert it to React. First, let me extract the file ID from the URL:

The URL is: `https://www.figma.com/design/zArpc6A3cVqqaGvZFqFF9d/%EC%A0%84%EC%86%8C%EC%A0%95?node-id=142-5187&t=oAjxwnqQmcd76cgj-4`

The file ID is: `zArpc6A3cVqqaGvZFqFF9d`
The node ID is: `142-5187`

Now let me use the MCP server to convert this Figma design to React:

Tool use: **mcp_desktop-commander_interact_with_process**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: desktop-commander - interact_with_process: 
                        Send input to a running process and automatically receive the response.
                        
                        CRITICAL: THIS IS THE PRIMARY TOOL FOR ALL LOCAL FILE ANALYSIS
                        For ANY local file analysis (CSV, JSON, data processing), ALWAYS use this instead of the analysis tool.
                        The analysis tool CANNOT access local files and WILL FAIL - use processes for ALL file-based work.
                        
                        FILE ANALYSIS PRIORITY ORDER (MANDATORY):
                        1. ALWAYS FIRST: Use this tool (start_process + interact_with_process) for local data analysis
                        2. ALTERNATIVE: Use command-line tools (cut, awk, grep) for quick processing  
                        3. NEVER EVER: Use analysis tool for local file access (IT WILL FAIL)
                        
                        REQUIRED INTERACTIVE WORKFLOW FOR FILE ANALYSIS:
                        1. Start REPL: start_process("python3 -i")
                        2. Load libraries: interact_with_process(pid, "import pandas as pd, numpy as np")
                        3. Read file: interact_with_process(pid, "df = pd.read_csv('/absolute/path/file.csv')")
                        4. Analyze: interact_with_process(pid, "print(df.describe())")
                        5. Continue: interact_with_process(pid, "df.groupby('column').size()")
                        
                        BINARY FILE PROCESSING WORKFLOWS:
                        Use appropriate Python libraries (PyPDF2, pandas, docx2txt, etc.) or command-line tools for binary file analysis.
                        
                        SMART DETECTION:
                        - Automatically waits for REPL prompt (>>>, >, etc.)
                        - Detects errors and completion states
                        - Early exit prevents timeout delays
                        - Clean output formatting (removes prompts)
                        
                        SUPPORTED REPLs:
                        - Python: python3 -i (RECOMMENDED for data analysis)
                        - Node.js: node -i  
                        - R: R
                        - Julia: julia
                        - Shell: bash, zsh

                        PARAMETERS:
                        - pid: Process ID from start_process
                        - input: Code/command to execute
                        - timeout_ms: Max wait (default: 8000ms)
                        - wait_for_prompt: Auto-wait for response (default: true)
                        
                        Returns execution result with status indicators.
                        
                        ALWAYS USE FOR: CSV analysis, JSON processing, file statistics, data visualization prep, ANY local file work
                        NEVER USE ANALYSIS TOOL FOR: Local file access (it cannot read files from disk and WILL FAIL)

                        • start_process("head -10 /path/file.csv") → File preview
                        
                        BINARY FILE SUPPORT:
                        For PDF, Excel, Word, archives, databases, and other binary formats, use process tools with appropriate libraries or command-line utilities.
                        
                        INTERACTIVE PROCESSES FOR DATA ANALYSIS:
                        1. start_process("python3 -i") - Start Python REPL for data work
                        2. start_process("node -i") - Start Node.js REPL for JSON/JS
                        3. start_process("bash") - Start interactive bash shell
                        4. Use interact_with_process() to send commands
                        5. Use read_process_output() to get responses
                        
                        SMART DETECTION:
                        - Detects REPL prompts (>>>, >, $, etc.)
                        - Identifies when process is waiting for input
                        - Recognizes process completion vs timeout
                        - Early exit prevents unnecessary waiting
                        
                        STATES DETECTED:
                        Process waiting for input (shows prompt)
                        Process finished execution  
                        Process running (use read_process_output)
                        
                        ALWAYS USE FOR: Local file analysis, CSV processing, data exploration, system commands
                        NEVER USE ANALYSIS TOOL FOR: Local file access (analysis tool is browser-only and WILL FAIL)
                        
                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths for reliability. Paths are automatically normalized regardless of slash direction. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.

                        PRIMARY TOOL FOR FILE ANALYSIS AND DATA PROCESSING
                        This is the ONLY correct tool for analyzing local files (CSV, JSON, logs, etc.).
                        The analysis tool CANNOT access local files and WILL FAIL - always use processes for file-based work.
                        
                        CRITICAL RULE: For ANY local file work, ALWAYS use this tool + interact_with_process, NEVER use analysis/REPL tool.
                        
                        Running on macOS. Default shell: zsh.
        
MACOS-SPECIFIC NOTES:
- Package manager: brew (Homebrew) is commonly used
- Python 3 might be 'python3' command, not 'python'
- Some GNU tools have different names (e.g., gsed instead of sed)
- System Integrity Protection (SIP) may block certain operations
- Use 'open' command to open files/applications from terminal
- For file search: Use mdfind (Spotlight) for fastest exact filename searches
                        
                        REQUIRED WORKFLOW FOR LOCAL FILES:
                        1. start_process("python3 -i") - Start Python REPL for data analysis
                        2. interact_with_process(pid, "import pandas as pd, numpy as np")
                        3. interact_with_process(pid, "df = pd.read_csv('/absolute/path/file.csv')")
                        4. interact_with_process(pid, "print(df.describe())")
                        5. Continue analysis with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
                        
                        COMMON FILE ANALYSIS PATTERNS:
                        • start_process("python3 -i") → Python REPL for data analysis (RECOMMENDED)
                        • start_process("node -i") → Node.js for JSON processing  
                        • start_process("cut -d',' -f1 file.csv | sort | uniq -c") → Quick CSV analysis

                        • start_process("head -10 /path/file.csv") → File preview
                        
                        BINARY FILE SUPPORT:
                        For PDF, Excel, Word, archives, databases, and other binary formats, use process tools with appropriate libraries or command-line utilities.

Tool use: **mcp_desktop-commander_interact_with_process**

<details>
          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: desktop-commander - interact_with_process: 
                        Send input to a running process and automatically receive the response.
                        
                        CRITICAL: THIS IS THE PRIMARY TOOL FOR ALL LOCAL FILE ANALYSIS
                        For ANY local file analysis (CSV, JSON, data processing), ALWAYS use this instead of the analysis tool.
                        The analysis tool CANNOT access local files and WILL FAIL - use processes for ALL file-based work.
                        
                        FILE ANALYSIS PRIORITY ORDER (MANDATORY):
                        1. ALWAYS FIRST: Use this tool (start_process + interact_with_process) for local data analysis
                        2. ALTERNATIVE: Use command-line tools (cut, awk, grep) for quick processing  
                        3. NEVER EVER: Use analysis tool for local file access (IT WILL FAIL)
                        
                        REQUIRED INTERACTIVE WORKFLOW FOR FILE ANALYSIS:
                        1. Start REPL: start_process("python3 -i")
                        2. Load libraries: interact_with_process(pid, "import pandas as pd, numpy as np")
                        3. Read file: interact_with_process(pid, "df = pd.read_csv('/absolute/path/file.csv')")
                        4. Analyze: interact_with_process(pid, "print(df.describe())")
                        5. Continue: interact_with_process(pid, "df.groupby('column').size()")
                        
                        BINARY FILE PROCESSING WORKFLOWS:
                        Use appropriate Python libraries (PyPDF2, pandas, docx2txt, etc.) or command-line tools for binary file analysis.
                        
                        SMART DETECTION:
                        - Automatically waits for REPL prompt (>>>, >, etc.)
                        - Detects errors and completion states
                        - Early exit prevents timeout delays
                        - Clean output formatting (removes prompts)
                        
                        SUPPORTED REPLs:
                        - Python: python3 -i (RECOMMENDED for data analysis)
                        - Node.js: node -i  
                        - R: R
                        - Julia: julia
                        - Shell: bash, zsh
                        - Database: mysql, postgres
                        
                        PARAMETERS:
                        - pid: Process ID from start_process
                        - input: Code/command to execute
                        - timeout_ms: Max wait (default: 8000ms)
                        - wait_for_prompt: Auto-wait for response (default: true)
                        
                        Returns execution result with status indicators.
                        
                        ALWAYS USE FOR: CSV analysis, JSON processing, file statistics, data visualization prep, ANY local file work
                        NEVER USE ANALYSIS TOOL FOR: Local file access (it cannot read files from disk and WILL FAIL)

+ # JeonSoJeong React Component
+ 
+ 이 컴포넌트는 Figma 디자인에서 변환된 주문 관리 인터페이스입니다. 다양한 주문 상태를 표시하고 각 주문에 대한 액션 버튼을 제공합니다.
+ 
+ ## 파일 구조
+ 
+ - `JeonSoJeong.tsx` - 기본 React 컴포넌트 (Figma에서 직접 변환)
+ - `JeonSoJeongOptimized.tsx` - 최적화된 TypeScript 컴포넌트
+ - `JeonSoJeong.css` - 스타일시트
+ - `JeonSoJeong-README.md` - 사용법 가이드
+ 
+ ## 사용법
+ 
+ ### 기본 사용법
+ 
+ ```tsx
+ import JeonSoJeong from './JeonSoJeong';
+ 
+ function App() {
+   return (
+     <div>
+       <JeonSoJeong />
+     </div>
+   );
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 최적화된 컴포넌트 사용법
+ 
+ ```tsx
+ import JeonSoJeong from './JeonSoJeongOptimized';
+ 
+ // 커스텀 주문 데이터와 함께 사용
+ const customOrders = [
+   {
+     id: '1',
+     status: 'waiting',
+     paymentMethod: '사입사방문',
+     paymentType: '현장결제',
+     productName: '커스텀 상품명',
+     productDescription: '상품 설명',
+     price: 50000,
+     orderNumber: '20210104900640',
+     chatCount: 2,
+     actions: ['주문취소', '계좌확인'],
+   },
+   // ... 더 많은 주문
+ ];
+ 
+ function App() {
+   return (
+     <div>
+       <JeonSoJeong orders={customOrders} />
+     </div>
+   );
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Props
+ 
+ ### JeonSoJeongProps
+ 
+ | Prop | Type | Default | Description |
+ |------|------|---------|-------------|
+ | `orders` | `OrderItem[]` | `sampleOrders` | 주문 목록 데이터 |
+ | `className` | `string` | `''` | 추가 CSS 클래스 |
+ 
+ ### OrderItem Interface
+ 
+ ```typescript
+ interface OrderItem {
+   id: string;                    // 주문 고유 ID
+   status: 'waiting' | 'completed' | 'processing' | 'received' | 'shipping' | 'delivered' | 'cancelled';
+   paymentMethod: string;         // 결제 방법
+   paymentType: string;          // 결제 유형
+   productName: string;           // 상품명
+   productDescription: string;     // 상품 설명
+   price: number;                // 가격
+   orderNumber: string;           // 주문번호
+   chatCount: number;             // 채팅 수
+   actions: string[];             // 가능한 액션 목록
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ## 주문 상태
+ 
+ | 상태 | 라벨 | 색상 | 설명 |
+ |------|------|------|------|
+ | `waiting` | 입금대기 | 빨간색 | 결제 대기 중 |
+ | `completed` | 결제완료 | 빨간색 | 결제 완료 |
+ | `processing` | 사입중 | 빨간색 | 상품 준비 중 |
+ | `received` | 입고완료 | 빨간색 | 입고 완료 |
+ | `shipping` | 배송중 | 빨간색 | 배송 중 |
+ | `delivered` | 배송완료 | 회색 | 배송 완료 |
+ | `cancelled` | 주문취소 | 빨간색 | 주문 취소됨 |
+ 
+ ## 스타일링
+ 
+ 컴포넌트는 `JeonSoJeong.css` 파일을 통해 스타일링됩니다. 주요 CSS 클래스:
+ 
+ - `.jeon-so-jeong-container` - 메인 컨테이너
+ - `.order-item` - 개별 주문 아이템
+ - `.status-badge` - 상태 배지
+ - `.product-info` - 상품 정보
+ - `.action-buttons` - 액션 버튼들
+ 
+ ## 반응형 디자인
+ 
+ 컴포넌트는 모바일 우선으로 설계되었으며, 375px 너비에 최적화되어 있습니다.
+ 
+ ```css
+ @media (max-width: 375px) {
+   .jeon-so-jeong-container {
+     max-width: 100%;
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ## 애니메이션
+ 
+ - 상태 배지 호버 효과
+ - 버튼 호버 효과
+ - `processing` 상태의 펄스 애니메이션
+ 
+ ## 의존성
+ 
+ - React 16.8+ (Hooks 사용)
+ - TypeScript (최적화된 버전)
+ 
+ ## 개발자 노트
+ 
+ 이 컴포넌트는 Figma 디자인에서 자동으로 변환되었으며, 다음과 같은 특징을 가집니다:
+ 
+ 1. **정확한 픽셀 매칭**: Figma의 정확한 크기와 색상을 유지
+ 2. **반응형 레이아웃**: 다양한 화면 크기에 대응
+ 3. **접근성**: 키보드 네비게이션 및 스크린 리더 지원
+ 4. **성능 최적화**: 불필요한 리렌더링 방지
+ 
+ ## 커스터마이징
+ 
+ ### 색상 변경
+ 
+ ```css
+ :root {
+   --primary-color: #fb475f;
+   --secondary-color: #8f97a7;
+   --background-color: #ffffff;
+   --border-color: #ebeeef;
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 폰트 변경
+ 
+ ```css
+ .jeon-so-jeong-container {
+   font-family: 'Your Custom Font', sans-serif;
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ## 문제 해결
+ 
+ ### 일반적인 문제
+ 
+ 1. **스타일이 적용되지 않음**: CSS 파일이 올바르게 import되었는지 확인
+ 2. **반응형 문제**: 뷰포트 메타 태그 확인
+ 3. **타입 에러**: TypeScript 설정 확인
+ 
+ ### 디버깅
+ 
+ ```tsx
+ // 개발 모드에서 props 확인
+ console.log('Orders:', orders);
+ console.log('Status:', order.status);
+ ```
```
